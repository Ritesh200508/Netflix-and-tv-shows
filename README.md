Netflix and TV shows
This project explores the Netflix dataset to analyze movies and TV shows available on the platform. Using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, the data was cleaned and structured for analysis. For visualization, Matplotlib and Seaborn were applied to create plots like bar charts, heatmaps, and pie charts that highlight trends in genres, ratings, release years, and countries. The analysis helps in understanding content distribution patterns, popular genres, and growth over time, offering insights into Netflixâ€™s content strategy
